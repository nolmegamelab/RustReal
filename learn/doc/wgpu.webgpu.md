# WebGPU spec

Reading the standard document clarifies the concepts involved in rendering. 
This is the effort of a large standarization organization, W3C. 

## Concepts. 

It is based on device queue and command like Vulkan, DX12 or Metal. 
Command and queue simplify rendering process and enable concurrency.
